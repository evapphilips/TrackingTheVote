					<p id="text">The voting system used in US presidential elections is called first past the post (FPTP).  In this system, voters choose one candidate on the ballot.  The candidate with the most votes wins.  Initially this system seems fair, however, upon further analysis FPTP voting has some inherent flaws.  The biggest flaw is that FPTP voting allows minority rule.  For example, say there are five candidates running for president and the votes are divided as follows, 42%, 15%, 22%, 9% and 12%.  In the FPTP system the first candidate with 42% of the vote would win even though all together the majority of the population voted for a different candidate. Also, FPTP voting promotes a two party system. When a smaller party</p>

				<div class="span2">
					<p id="text">recognizes that their candidate cannot win their voters will often choose a more popular party.  However, these voters often strategize and vote against the candidate they don't like rather than voting for a candidate they do like.  Eventually both third party candidates and voters get disinterested and the larger two parties control the elections (1).<br><br>For a more detailed look at FPTP voting watch <a id="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo">this video by CGP Grey</a>.</p>

					<p id="text">Some states have adopted an alternative voting system called ranked choice voting for their state elections.  Some argue that this system should be used for presidential elections.  While ranked choice voting has it’s own flaws, it solves some of the key faults that result from FPTP.  In this system, voters rank the candidates in order of preference on the ballot.  Once first choice votes are tallied, if no candidate has the majority, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and the second choice votes of their supporters are tallied.  This repeats until a candidate either wins the majority or there is only one candidate left. In addition to removing the possibility of minority rule, this system also</p>

					<p id="text">solves a problem called the spoiler effect.  The spoiler effect happens when there is a third party candidate whose votes are larger than the difference between the two main parties.  This cannot happen in ranked choice voting and allows people to support third party candidates that they agree with without worrying that they will put someone they don't like into office.  Of course, this system has its own flaws as well.  Both FPTP and ranked choice voting do not protect against gerrymandering and they both trend toward a two party system (2).<br><br>For a more detailed look at ranked choice voting watch <a id="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">this video by CGP Grey</a>.</p>

					<p id="text"style="margin-right: 30px; margin-top: 10px">The first hurdle in the voting process requires individuals in this population to register to vote.  The deadline to register in most states is a few weeks before election day.  For those who don’t closely follow the election timeline, this deadline can come and go without them realizing.  The criteria to register to vote in a state is not just determined by a persons age.  Each state has it’s own voter ID laws. Thus, in some cases, even the process of registering to vote has become politicized.  Many states deliberately require individuals to register early and remove a same day registration option.  Both red and blue states do this to strategically keep voting turn out low for the benefit of their own party.  Of course, for others, the decision not to register to vote is a personal choice usually due to them missing the registration deadline. <br><br> If voting is a civil right, why is our system intentionally designed to eliminate voters at the registration stage? <br><br>The visualization to the right eliminates the individuals in the population who were not able to or chose not to register to vote.  All together, 64.2% of the voting age population were registered for the 2016 election (3).</p>
